## Validation

### W3 HTML
I validated the HTML with [W3 Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The results can be seen below;
 - [index](design-resources/images/index-html-warnings.PNG)
 - [avengers](design-resources/images/avengers-html-warnings.PNG)

 **Warnings**
    The index form showed an error for a empty "<meta name=""> value. I corrected this by adding meta description, author and keywords for both html pages.
    All pages showed warnings regarding HTML semantics and use H2-6's in sections, however upon review I am happy that all headings are relevant for page layout. So I decided not to enact any changes.

### W3 CSS 
I also validated the CSS with the [w3 Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and it found no errors.
