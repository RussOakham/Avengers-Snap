## Validation

### W3 HTML
I validated the HTML with [W3 Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). The results can be seen below;
 - [index](design-resources/images/index-html-warnings.PNG)
 - [avengers](design-resources/images/avengers-html-warnings.PNG)

 **Warnings**
    The index form showed an error for a empty "<meta name=""> value. I corrected this by adding meta description, author and keywords for both html pages.
    All pages showed warnings regarding HTML semantics and use H2-6's in sections, however upon review I am happy that all headings are relevant for page layout. So I decided not to enact any changes.

### W3 CSS 
I validated the CSS with the [w3 Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and it found no errors.

### JavaScript 
I validated the JavaScript with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/), which returned on minor syntax errors, such as missing semi-colons, which I proceeded to update.

 - [modals.js](design-resources/images/JSHint-modals-js-result.PNG)
 - [audio.js](design-resources/images/JSHint-audio-js-result.PNG)
 
 All three tests showed inaccurate issues with undefined and unused variables, as the variables are used in the other JavaScript files.

### Google Lighthouse Audit
I used Google's lighthouse audiot to test the website conforms positively with Google's performance metrics, with the aim of achieveing scores of 90% in all areas on desktop.
