# Avengers Snap - by Russell Oakham

## Project overview

'Avengers Snap' is an interactive card matching game themed around Marvels Avengers.

The game is created to engage and entertain users of all ages, especially those who enjoy Marvels comic and cinematic universe. It has been designed to be immersive and stimulating to users, via interactive elements such as animations and sound cues. The game is easy to play but offers various difficulty lessons for prolonged user engagement.

I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the game, ensuring it is fully responsive to the users chosen device.

## Deployed site
The live website can be found at the following link;

## 1. UX

Overview of UX decisions, structure etc. Examples of websites I have viewed as part of research & resulting UX design decisions.

### User Stories
 - As a curious user, I want the home screen to be visually appealing, as this will positively aid my decision in whether I want to play the game. 
 - As a user, I want the site to be easy and intuitive to navigate.
 - As a user, I want to easily access the game, tutorials, difficulty and audio controls for the website.
 - As a user, I want to be able to choose a difficulty level for the game and know how the game changes across difficulty.
 - As a user, I want to be able to restart the game if necessary, without having to navigate away from the game screen.
 - As a user, I want to be able to keep track of the number of moves I make and the time I take to complete the game, so I can try to improve on future plays.
 - As a user, I want the cards to be randomised, so the image locations are different with each replay. 

### Structure
As the purpose of the website is to showcase the card game, I want to ensure the rest of the website is simple and each page element enhances the game experience. Therefore I followed the following structure;

 - **Home Page**: Containing the following elements.
    - *Header/Footer*: For easy navigation across the site.
    - *Website Logo*: To easily identify the 'Avengers Snap' game branding.
    - *Avengers Snap Game*: Card Matching Game, with timer, move counter and reset button.
    - *Starting Modal*: Modal on page load, explaining how to play and prompting the user to choose a difficulty.
    - *Game Complete Modal*: Modal on game completion, congratulating player, providing move and timer score. Prompts to play again, or change the difficulty.

- **Avengers Page**: Page providing additional information about Marvels Avengers, plus Bio for featured heroes.

### Skeleton
At this point I began creating wireframes, using the above structure considerations. I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) these below;

- [Home page on desktop and mobile](assets/design-resources/images/Home.PNG)
- [Home Page - welcome modal on desktop and mobile](assets/design-resources/images/Modals.PNG)
- [Avengers Page on desktop and mobile](assets/design-resources/images/Avengers-Page.PNG)

### Surface
This is the sensory design section of a website, or how it looks, feels and sounds. I wanted the design to be clean and the colour scheme to be reminiscent of Marvel's cinematic universe, as it is a very popular brand internationally. 

#### Colour & Comic Styling
As the game is inspired by Marvels Avengers, I was keen to use a colour scheme in line with the Marvel brand and maintain a comic book feel, so the site identity is instantly recognisable to fans of the franchise.

With this in mind I chose to use variations of the below colours for the core design of the website;
- Blue
- Yellow
- Orange
- Green
- Red
- Purple

For the page background, I chose a 'Captain America Blue' (Hex: #3268BD) which was originally curated by iamtheagirl on [color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/7706).

![Colour Scheme 1](design-resources/colour-palette/avengers-color-palette-color-hex.com.png)

To achieve a strong comic book style I researched online and found the following article which I used for inspiration. The article shows that via the use of CSS techniques such as radial-gradient colour backgrounds and skew on some elements, you can achieve a strong comic book identity for your site.

[Code my UI - CSS Only Mobile-Friendly Comic Book Layout](https://codemyui.com/css-mobile-friendly-comic-book-layout/)

#### Language/Tone 
I wanted the language to reflect the casual and fun atmosphere of the game, so content was written in line with this. Avoiding technical or formal language where possible.

Similarly, I wanted to use fonts that reinforce the strong comic book identity of the site. To achieve this I used two [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/);

- [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers?preview.text_type=custom)
- [Comic Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comic+Neue?preview.text_type=custom)
- Cursive- Web safe font, used if primary two fonts fail to load.

#### Styling Considerations
Before beginning development, I listed some styling ideas that I felt benefit the website. The majority of these can be seen in the wireframes.

 - Favicon: Desktop and Mobile.
 - Game: 
    - Cards react to mouse hover (transform: Zoom) to add a level of interaction and excitement in selecting cards.
    - Card Border Shadows - flash red when cards are matched incorrectly, turn to static green when cards matched correctly.
    - Audio Cues: To further improve interactivity and accessibility, play audio sound cues when cards are flipped. With additional positive/negative cues for if cards are matched correctly or incorrectly.
 - Modals:
    - Welcome Modal: Pop up on game page load, explaining how to play the game, plus provide difficulty options.
    - Completion Modal: Pop up once the game is complete, congratulating the player and providing move and time scores. Offer option to play again or 
 - Navigation
    - Sticky top
    - Mobile: 'Burger' menu icon, expanding on click.
    - Logo: Navigates to the home page on click.
