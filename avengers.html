                    <p>
                        During the dark days of the early 1940's, a covert U.S. Military experiment turned Steve Rogers
                        into America's first Super-Soldier, Captain America. Throughout the war, Cap and his partner,
                        Bucky fought alongside infantry and with a group of heroes known as the Invaders. In the closing
                        months of World War II, Captain America and Bucky were both presumed dead in an explosion.
                        Decades later, Captain America was found trapped in ice and revived in the modern world. Captain
                        America would then later go on to be one of the most important members of the Avengers as well
                        as a leader of the team.

                        Ant-Man is a legacy super-hero name, primarily associated with the ability to shrink in size.
                        The original was Hank Pym; he was a founding member of the Avengers. Scott Lang took the name,
                        an ex-con who broke into the New Jersey home of Dr. Henry Pym, and stole the Ant-Man's Suit.
                        Lang has been a member of the Avengers, Fantastic Four and Future Foundation. Eric O'Grady took
                        the mantle until his death.

                    <p>
                        The son of boxer Battlin' Jack, Matt Murdock grew up in the relative poverty of Hell's Kitchen
                        with much reverence for his father. 
                        
                        As a boy, Matt witnessed a man about to be hit by a truck
                        and pushed him out of the way but the truck crashed and spilled its cargo of extremely toxic
                        chemicals into his face. He awoke in the hospital blind from the toxins and learned that his
                        other senses were amplified and was able to see by a radar-like sense using natural sounds around him, giving him ultimate confidence in his surroundings. He
                        met a blind martial arts master named Stick, who taught him to hone his senses and trained him
                        in martial arts.

                        As an adult, he became a lawyer and opened a law firm with Foggy Nelson while secretly taking on
                        the mantle of Daredevil in order to protect the citizens of Hell's Kitchen

                    <p>
                        Wade Wilson was an international assassin who had worked for various governments when he developed an aggressive cancer. In an effort to find a cure, he enrolled in the Weapon X program in Canada, which gave him a healing factor from another member and set him to work for them. When he killed a team member, he was thrown out of the program and was sent to have his abilities removed, where he was experimented on instead. The results of his stay there were a diminished mental state, a healing factor that could not cure his cancer or heal his scars, an infatuation with death, and his freedom to return to for-hire mercenary work. As "The Merc with a Mouth" he set out as Deadpool to kill and have a good time doing it.

                        Groot was a Flora colossi from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds. He did not get along with his fellow saplings, instead preferring the company of the "Maintenance Mammals" who the other saplings treated with prejudice.
                        Into his adulthood, Groot found himself in Kree space, where he was promptly captured and imprisoned. While in jail, he formed a rapport with Rocket Raccoon and was assigned to a covert ops team led by Starlord.
                        Groot joined Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy, alongside many of those he had fought against the Phalanx alongside, including Rocket.
