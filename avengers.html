                    <p>
                        During the dark days of the early 1940's, a covert U.S. Military experiment turned Steve Rogers
                        into America's first Super-Soldier, Captain America.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the war, Cap and his partner,
                        Bucky fought alongside infantry and with a group of heroes known as the Invaders. In the closing
                        months of World War II, Captain America and Bucky were both presumed dead in an explosion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Decades later, Captain America was found trapped in ice and revived in the modern world. Captain
                        America would then later go on to be one of the most important members of the Avengers as well
                        as a leader of the team.

                    <p>
                        The son of boxer Battlin' Jack, Matt Murdock grew up in the relative poverty of Hell's Kitchen
                        with much reverence for his father.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a boy, Matt witnessed a man about to be hit by a truck
                        and pushed him out of the way but the truck crashed and spilled its cargo of extremely toxic
                        chemicals into his face. He awoke in the hospital blind from the toxins and learned that his
                        other senses were amplified and was able to see by a radar-like sense using natural sounds
                        around him, giving him ultimate confidence in his surroundings. He
                        met a blind martial arts master named Stick, who taught him to hone his senses and trained him
                        in martial arts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an adult, he became a lawyer and opened a law firm with Foggy Nelson while secretly taking on
                        the mantle of Daredevil in order to protect the citizens of Hell's Kitchen

                        developed an aggressive cancer. In an effort to find a cure, he enrolled in the Weapon X program
                        in Canada, which gave him a healing factor from another member and set him to work for them.

                        When he killed a team member, he was thrown out of the program and was sent to have his

                        diminished mental state, a healing factor that could not cure his cancer or heal his scars, an
                        infatuation with death, and his freedom to return to for-hire mercenary work.<br> As "The Merc

                        imprisoned. While in jail, he formed a rapport with Rocket Raccoon and was assigned to a covert
                        ops team led by Starlord.

                        gamma radiation that altered his DNA structure due to gamma rays and trauma passed down by his
                        father and caused him to become a giant green monster of incredible power known

                        wounded in a war zone in Afghanistan shortly before being kidnapped by terrorists. Stark built
                        an armored suit to escape captivity, which doubled as a device to keep his heart beating. Once
                        he returned to the United States, Stark reinvented himself as the armor-clad

                    <p>
                        Thanos was one of the last son of A'Lars and Sui-San, the last survivor of the original
                        settlement of Eternals on Titan. Born with
                        purple, hide-like skin and a massive body due to being born with the Deviant Syndrome, Thanos
                        was a morose child who became obsessed with the concept of death. Through bionic implementation
                        and long hours of meditation, Thanos augmented his Eternal strengths and powers so that his
                        abilities surpassed those of all other Titanian Eternals.

                    <p>
                        Using science and his unmatched cunning, Thanos created the Infinity Gauntlet, giving him
                        mastery of Soul Gems.
                        Using the massive power now in his possession,Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to remove half
                        of the population of the universe, causing dire consequences with his actions and becoming sworn
                        enemy of Earths Avengers.

                        The Asgardian God of Thunder, Thor Odinson, is the
                        son of Odin the All-Father and Jord, Elder Goddess and spirit of the Earth.

                        alongside the Avengers in the defense of the people of Midgard (Earth). However, Loki's subtle
                        trickery and manipulations of Balder, Thor was banished from
                        Asgard, stripping him of his titles, throne and legal power, and his people moved to Doctor
                        Doom's Latveria.

                    <p>
                        Thor returned to Asgard, just in
                        time to aid them in a battle against Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers, X-Men, and H.A.M.M.E.R.
                        Feeling lonely, Thor has resurrected his brother Loki
                        and father Odin and they continue to battle-on for the survival of Asgard.

                        With a past shrouded in mystery, Wolverine's memories are full of government secrets, traumatic
                        events, and death. Remembering only escaping from Weapon X and later joining Alpha Flight, the
                        man known as Logan was approached with a chance to change the world, by Professor Charles
                        Xavier.

                        After joining Professor X's X-Men, Wolverine has been using his mutant powers, to heal at an
                        accelerated rate, enhanced physical condition, animal-like instincts, and razor sharp bone claws
                        that protrude from between his knuckles laced with the indestructible metal Adamantium like the
                        rest of his skeleton, to fight for the peaceful coexistence of mutants and humans most of his
                        life.
